# ThePetShopApp

Hello world! This Is A project given to me as a part of Sela College studies and it is a pet shop. The app displays a catalogue of pets currently available in database (Sql server and EF6), uses registration and user validation based on roles. As a user you can see and commen existing animals, sign in\sign out and create a personal account (which you will need to add a comment). An admin page offers some tools as editing, deleting and creating new animals, upload photos, and monitoring and deleting commets (because moderation is still a thing). The styles are built using BootStrap, and a tiled layout - using Masonry, cascading grid layout library.

Tech:
ASP.NET CORE
Bootstrap
Masonry 
HTML, CSS, JS
